  We will have a dedicated block for screen readers to mitigate an issue with
  VoiceOver treating spans as distinct elements and forcing users to navigate
  between them.

    <span>{{wind.speed}} {{ "mph" | t }}</span>
    {#
    The +180 here is to account for the fact that wind direction
    is reported as a FROM direction, but our arrow points in the
    TO direction. So we just need to spin it 'round.
    #}
    <svg role="img" aria-hidden="true" data-wind-direction class="width-2 height-2 margin-left-05 padding-2px" style="transform: rotate({{ wind.direction.angle + 180 }}deg);">

    </svg>
  </div>
  {#
  By putting all of the content into a single span, we can get VoiceOver to read
  it in a more natural way.
  #}
  <span class="usa-sr-only">{{ "@speed mph from the @direction" | t({"@speed":wind.speed,"@direction": wind.direction.long }) }}</span>
